Welcome to my OpenCode command center! ✨

This repo gives you a clean, portable OpenCode setup with fast MCP controls inside OpenCode itself. Keep autonomous coding smooth, and only turn on external context when you actually need it. ⚡

Start here: `docs/quickstart.md`

## Related playbook repo

For the reusable delivery contract and lighter-weight policy docs that complement this runtime repo, search your local clone first when available, and use these public references when you need a shareable or canonical link:

- `https://github.com/dmoliveira/agents.md/blob/main/AGENTS.md`
- `https://github.com/dmoliveira/agents.md/blob/main/docs/index.md`
- `https://github.com/dmoliveira/agents.md/blob/main/docs/validation-policy.md`
- `https://github.com/dmoliveira/agents.md/blob/main/docs/plan/README.md`

Treat them as optional supporting references, not required startup context for every run.

## Local dev install

For a live local checkout that OpenCode reads directly, use the bootstrap script:

```bash
./scripts/setup_local_dev_symlinks.sh
```

This keeps `~/.config/opencode/my_opencode` pointed at your working repo, keeps `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` pointed at this repo's `opencode.json`, symlinks repo agents into `~/.config/opencode/agent/`, refreshes `AGENTS.md` from the sibling `../agents_md/AGENTS.md`, and creates the `plugin/gateway-core@latest` symlink used by the local file-plugin workaround.

## Why this setup rocks 🎯

- **One source of truth** for global OpenCode config.
- **Token-aware workflow** by keeping managed MCPs disabled by default.
- **Instant MCP toggling** with `/mcp` commands in the OpenCode prompt.
- **Portable install** with a one-liner script and symlinked default config path.
- **Worktree-first repo**: start each task in a dedicated git worktree branch and keep the main project folder off task branches.

## Agent roles (Tab menu)

This setup keeps `build` as the default agent for quick direct work, exposes only `build`, `plan`, and `orchestrator` in the `Tab` switcher, and keeps focused specialists available as hidden secondary subagents:

- `orchestrator` (primary): execution lead for complex tasks, with explicit delegation and completion gates.
- `explore` (subagent): read-only internal codebase scout.
- `librarian` (subagent): read-only external docs and OSS evidence researcher.
- `oracle` (subagent): read-only architecture/debug advisor for hard tradeoffs.
- `verifier` (subagent): read-only validation runner for test/lint/build checks.
- `reviewer` (subagent): read-only quality/risk review pass before final delivery.
- `release-scribe` (subagent): read-only PR/changelog/release-notes writer from git evidence.
- `strategic-planner` (subagent): read-only sequencing and milestone planning specialist.
- `ambiguity-analyst` (subagent): read-only assumptions and unknowns surfacer for unclear scope.
- `plan-critic` (subagent): read-only feasibility and gate-coverage critic for concrete plans.

Default selection note:

- `build` remains the configured `default_agent` in `opencode.json` for speed.
- `plan` remains the built-in planning primary in OpenCode.
- choose `orchestrator` when you want end-to-end multi-step execution with delegation and completion gates.
- specialist subagents stay hidden from `Tab` and are meant for delegation or explicit `@agent` invocation.

Agent files live in `agent/*.md` and install globally to `~/.config/opencode/agent/`.
Agent source-of-truth specs live in `agent/specs/*.json` and generate markdown via `scripts/build_agents.py`.

Quick validation:

```text
/agent-doctor
/agent-doctor --json
```

## Operations Notes

Detailed roadmap history, implementation baselines, and deep-dive capability notes are now maintained in `docs/readme-deep-notes.md` to keep this README focused on day-to-day operator workflows.

Use these references for deeper context:

- `docs/readme-deep-notes.md`
- `docs/plan/oh-my-opencode-parity-high-value-plan.md`
- `docs/upstream-divergence-registry.md`
- `instructions/agent_operating_contract.md`

## Command Handbook 📚

The full slash-command catalog now lives in `docs/command-handbook.md`.

Quickstart commands:

```text
/doctor run
/plugin status
/mcp status
/notify status
/delivery status --json
/autopilot go --goal "finish current objective" --json
/autoflow status --json
/gateway status
```

Enable MCPs only when the task benefits from extra context, for example with `/mcp profile research`.

Recommended command split:
- `/delivery` for day-to-day issue delivery and closeout
- `/workflow` for lower-level workflow validation and resume control
- `/autopilot` for open-ended autonomous execution
- `/autoflow` for explicit plan-file execution

Before implementation work, create a dedicated git worktree branch for the task. Do not edit task files from the main project folder, and do not `git checkout` or `git switch` that folder onto a task branch.

Protected branches (`main`, `master`) in the primary project folder are edit-blocked by default, and bash usage there is limited to inspection, validation, exact sync commands, and narrow read-only SQLite inspection such as `sqlite3 -readonly ... .tables`: `git fetch`, `git fetch --prune`, and `git pull --rebase`.

Use `/complete <prefix>` for command discovery, `docs/command-handbook.md` for full command examples, `docs/operator-playbook.md` for canonical operator flows, and `docs/parallel-wt-playbook.md` for the worktree-first execution checklist.

Managed `/mcp` names: `context7`, `gh_grep`, `playwright`, `exa_search`, `firecrawl`, `github`.

Aliases: `ghgrep` -> `gh_grep`, `exa` -> `exa_search`.

Profiles:
- `minimal` -> disable all managed MCPs
- `research` -> `context7`, `gh_grep`
- `web` -> `playwright`, `exa_search`, `firecrawl`
- `all` -> enable all managed MCPs
