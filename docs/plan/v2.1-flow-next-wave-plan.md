# v2.1 Flow Next Wave Plan

## Goal

Define the next flow-upgrade wave after v2.0 closure, focused on release scalability, artifact quality, and operator ergonomics.

## Status Legend

- pending
- in progress
- done
- blocked

## Validation Gates

- `make validate`
- `make selftest`
- `make install-test`
- `pre-commit run --all-files`

## Epics

### E1 Release train composability

- [x] Add reusable release-train profile presets for docs-only and runtime releases
- [x] Add selftest coverage for profile-driven publish planning behavior
- [x] Document profile selection guidance in runbook/handbook

### E2 Artifact provenance hardening

- [ ] Add explicit provenance metadata block to generated release-note artifacts
- [ ] Add deterministic provenance validation checks in selftest
- [ ] Add migration notes for downstream consumers

### E3 Docs automation signal quality

- [ ] Add docs automation summary index page updates for each release cycle
- [ ] Add validation that wiki/pages automation output remains synchronized
- [ ] Add operator-facing troubleshooting guidance for docs automation failures

### E4 Plan hygiene automation

- [ ] Add lightweight checker to flag stale plan entries missing closure evidence links
- [ ] Add doctor/readiness command hint integration for plan hygiene findings
- [ ] Add regression tests for checker behavior across completed and active plans

### E5 Release cadence consolidation

- [ ] Add periodic rollup doc template for grouping multiple v0.4.x-style releases
- [ ] Add `release-index-update` runbook examples with verification snippets
- [ ] Capture policy for ending a release wave and transitioning to next minor plan
